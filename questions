Question: error: Failed to create a worklet. Did you forget to add Reanimated Babel plugin in babel.config.js?
See installation docs at https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation#babel-plugin., js engine: hermes
Answer:
step 1: add following lines(in this file): babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
 -> env: {
    production: {
      plugins: ['react-native-paper/babel'],
    },
  },
 -> plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
};
step 2: run metro using this command
-> npx react-native start --reset-cache
